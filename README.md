# LV. 0 - Curiosone
Conosco poco o niente di Bitcoin e vorrei saperne di più

-----

## Step 1. Get a Wallet
*Aim: Make and backup a bitcoin wallet*

1.	Download <a href="https://blockstream.com/green/" target="_blank">Blockstream Green wallet</a>.
2.	Make a new wallet and write down the 24 words presented to you. These 24 words act as a key to access your bitcoin.
3.  Make another copy of these words and put them both somewhere hidden/safe in your house.
4.	In green wallet, click receive and copy the address shown on screen, this can be done by clicking on the QR code.

-----

## Step 2. Buy some bitcoin
*Aim: Get a small amount of bitcoin*

- Only buy a small amount of bitcoin to start (in a later step we will improve your backup redundancy).
- These recommendations let you buy bitcoin quickly at the cost of reduced privacy.
- Buying Privately is detailed in a <a href="#step-12-buying=privately" target="_blank">later step.</a>


##### USA (1.5% Fee)
0.  Check cashapp on <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/cash.app" target="_blank">Trustpilot</a>
1.	Download <a href="https://cash.app/" target="_blank">Cashapp</a> from the app store.
2.	Make an account & connect a Debit Card.
3.	Buy 25 USD of BTC.
4.	Find the Withdraw Bitcoin button, specify an amount and paste your first bitcoin address from Step 1.
5.	Wait for the funds to appear in green wallet (< 24 hrs).

##### EU (Bittr - 1.5% Fee)
0.  Check bittr on <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/getbittr.com" target="_blank">Trustpilot</a>

2.	Enter your email & phone number
3.	Paste your first bitcoin address from Step 1

4.	Wait for the funds to appear in green wallet (< 24 hrs).  


Congrats you now officially hold some BTC. As long as you keep those 24 words safe nobody can steal the funds from the wallet you have created. Without these words (known as your seed words or your private key) nobody can access your bitcoin wallet.

2. Evaluate below tables to determine which route seems most suitable given:


|                       | Route A       | Route B       | Route C       | Route D       |  
| --                    | --            | --            | --            | --            |
| Cost                  | Zero          | Zero          | Low           | **High**      |
| Time Requirement      | Low           | **High**      | **Mid/High**  | Low           |
| Setup Difficulty      | Low           | **High**      | Mid           | Low           |
| Downtime              | **High**      | Low           | Low           | Low           |


| Route | Ideal User | Positives     | Negatives     | 
| --            | --            | --    | -- |
| A | Non-technical Beginner | Free, Easy and Quick | When your computer is off your node will not be running so when you do want to use it you will have to wait for it to sync.|
| B | Technical Enthusiast | Free | Requires significant time to setup & is technologically difficult if you have not used linux before.|
| C | Less Technical Enthusiast | Reasonably low cost & quick | Requires some time to setup though typically guides specify hardware making setup as simple as following instructions precisely. |
| D | Anyone who can comfortably afford this option | Quick and Easy | High cost compared to alternatives |
